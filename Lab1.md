# Installing VScode - 
First, we need to install an application where we would write our commands. The software we will be using for this purpose is VScode.
In order to download and install it, open a browser (like Chrome, Firefox etc.) and type the url *https://code.visualstudio.com/download*.
Now, figure out which OS you are using (Windows, Mac etc) and install VScode for that OS. We are good to go.

# Remotely Connecting - 
Second, install git. Since I use a Mac so I didn't need to install git externally on my laptop. 
Then open the terminal on VScode. Your screen should look like the attached screenshot.

Then type the command *"ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu"*, replace *"zz"* by your course specific account's letters.
You will encounter a message if you are trying to log in for the first time to which you need to type in "yes" and press enter. Then enter your password.

You will not be able to see your typed-in password for security reasons. Nonetheless, your password is written there. Press enter again.
Now you will see the below displayed message which shows that your computer has been connected to the server.

Now try to play around with some commands like cd, pwd, ls,cat and cp.
In order to log out or disconnect from the remote server, run the command *"exit"* or press Ctrl+D.
